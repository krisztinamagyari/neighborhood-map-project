# Neighborhood Map Project

## Overview
The project has been created as part of Udacity's Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree course.
It is a single page application made by React. It shows schools in the city of Debrecen (Hungary) where I live.
The application uses [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) to display a map, and [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com) to get info about the places.
